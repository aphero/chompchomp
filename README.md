# Chomp Chomp menu

An admin view of an online menu that allows for adding, editing and deleting menu items from specified courses.

# How to use

The root displays the entire menu as you would see it from a user standpoint, but with additional options for editing the menu.  You may click on dish names in order to edit or delete them through a form view.  You may also add items via a linkk below the course name.

# Problems

I burned a lot of time trying to figure out how to use best_in_place to allow for editing items by clicking on the text to switch to an edit text field.  This time sink caused me to change my game plan and develop without TDD.  Lesson learned: use what you know and do the project right instead of try to learn something that will be taught in a couple weeks anyway.
